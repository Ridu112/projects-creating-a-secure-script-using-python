I have an assignment where I have to ask the user for a 4 digit pin. 
The correct pin is combination of letters, number and characters. I have to give the user 3 times before they're locked out. 
I also have to add a break statement. This is the example of the outpu


desired_pin = '0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y z, !, @, #, $, %, &'
max_tries = 3


def verify_pin(the_pin):
    return the_pin == desired_pin


def main():
    tries = 0

    while tries < max_tries:
        pin = input('please enter your pin code: ')
        if verify_pin(pin):
            print('Correct')
            break
        else:
            print('Incorrect. Please enter again: ')
        tries += 1

    else:   # Else will run when no `break` statement is run in while loop.
        print("I am LOCKIN' you out now!")
